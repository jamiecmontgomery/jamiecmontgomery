### Hi there 👋

🏫 I am the coordinator for the [Master’s of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) (MEDS) professional degree program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. 

🌊 Previously, I worked as a marine data scientist where I focused on assessing the health of our oceans 🌡️, conservation aquaculture 🐟, and data-limited fisheries 🎣.

🤸‍♀️ I am an enthusiastic proponent of open, reproducible science and programming with R, co-founder of [EcoDataScience](https://eco-data-science.github.io/) and [RLadies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/). 

While I will always be a marine scientist 🤿, my current focus is on supporting the next generation of Environmental Data Scientists through MEDS 🌱.
